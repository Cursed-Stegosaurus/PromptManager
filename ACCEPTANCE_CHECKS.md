## ✅ Prompt Management

- [x] **Insert works in textarea**
  - Direct insertion into focused elements
  - Support for input, textarea, contenteditable

  - AES-GCM encryption algorithm

- [x] **Encrypted prompts read and write when passphrase provided**
  - Secure key derivation from passphrase
  - No passphrase storage (user must remember)
  - Seed prompts remain unencrypted

## ✅ Import/Export

- [x] **Import/restore merge previews counts**
  - Shows counts of added, updated, skipped prompts
  - Conflict resolution based on `updatedAt` timestamp
  - Never modifies seed prompts

- [x] **Preserves newer edits**

  - Generate OAuth2 credentials
  - Update manifest.json

- [ ] **Finalize icon set and screenshots**
  - Create custom icons for all sizes
  - Design consistent visual language
  - Prepare Web Store screenshots

- [ ] **Prepare Unlisted Chrome Web Store listing**
